# ConsoleSyncChat
This was simply my first time using asio for networking. 

## How to use
At first run you should select host so windows will allow the networking lol.

After that you can create a port as host and the client can join your IPv4 on the port you created.

## SYNC
The application is not async, so when you send a message you can't send anything else before you get a message back
